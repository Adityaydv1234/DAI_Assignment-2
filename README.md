About the Dataset
The data in this dataset has been collected from a restaurant over a period of time. Each entry represents a unique transaction, capturing details about the bill amount, tip given, the gender of the person paying, smoking preference, day of the week, time of day, and the size of the dining party. This dataset can be used to analyze tipping behavior and understand the factors that influence the amount of tip given. Potential analyses include examining the relationship between the total bill and tip amount, exploring differences in tipping behaviour based on gender or smoking preference, and studying how the day of the week or time of day impacts tips. This data is useful for restaurateurs, economists, and social scientists interested in consumer behaviour.

1.total_bill: The total bill amount, including the cost of food and drink 2. .
